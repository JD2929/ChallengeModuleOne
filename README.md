Module One Challenge for Bootcamp

## Goals
-to make the webpage more accessible by
  1. adding alt to images for screen readers
  2. using semantic elements

## Changes 
-Changes were made to both the HTML and CSS code to provide better accessibility and to include a general reformation of the code base. 
-although there were several classes that were identical in properties, I spoke to Sal Hobbi and it was decided to leave these as separate classes and not fold them into one to maintain the ability to later change each section individually.
